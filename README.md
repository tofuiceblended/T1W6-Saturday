# Python Term 1 Week 6 Saturday Class

# If-Else Practice Acitivity

## Building a calculator
Build a calculator that takes 3 inputs from the user:
2 inputs as numbers(floats) for operation and 3rd input to decide which operation they want to perform

# Lists
Composite Data Type, meaning multiple data types can be stored in one variable. 
Each piece is called an element.

# Loops

Like Post Malone describes, "Run away, but we're running in circles"
Used to repeat a block of code multiple times until a certain condition is met.

DRY Coding Principle: Don't Repeat Yourself

Examples: Counting coins in your piggy bank

'If' condition would decide whether or not to run the intended block. Whereas,
Loops would decide how many times the user wants to run the intended block

# While loop
While the condition is met, keep executing the intended block. If not met, skip the block. Ctrl + C to escape

Things to consider:
    - Program can enter the loop
    - Program can exit the loop
